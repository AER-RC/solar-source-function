build_comb_solar_rad_multi_comp.bin -
                     Binary solar irradiance spectrum based on the NRLSSI2 model; it contains:
                     - a temporallly invariant component, derived by modifying the high spectral
                     Kurucz solar irradiance and Toon solar transmittance to obtain consistency 
                     with the coarser NRLSSI2 model irradiance values; 
                     - NRLSSI2 facular brightening and sunspot darkening components fixed to the 
                     mean solar cycle.
                     The spectral resolution is 0.01 cm-1. Units are W/(m2 cm-1).

build_comb_solar_rad_avg.bin -
                     Binary solar irradiance spectrum which contains the sum of 
                     the three components described above averaged over the mean solar cycle.
                     The spetral resolution is 0.01 cm-1. Units are (W/m2 cm-1).

                      ranges from 0.0001 cm-1 at 50.000043 cm-1 to

                      range spans 50.-50000. cm-1. Each 1 cm-1 bin is

extract_solar.f - 
            Fortran program which extracts the binary solar data from

            interpolated to a user-defined grid (input via the file
            SOLAR_control) in ascii or binary format.



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INPUT FILE DESCRIPTION: SOLAR_control

Record 1: Holerith description of file

Record 2: CFLAG: Flag for interpolation or simple extraction of data

          *** Note: when creating SOLAR.RAD files for LBLRTM use one of the intxxxx options.

          "ext_nrl": extracts spectra from build_comb_solar_rad_avg.bin at its internal spectral resolution
          "int_nrl": extracts spectra from build_comb_solar_rad_avg.bin and interpolates to a user specified
                     resolution

          "ext3nrl": extracts spectra from build_comb_solar_rad_multi_comp.bin at its internal spectral resolution
          "int3nrl": extracts spectra from build_comb_solar_rad_multi_comp.bin and interpolates to a user specified
                     resolution
           *** Note:  All three terms are output 

          "extract": extracts spectra from solar.kurucz.rad.mono.full_disk.bin.little_Endian at its internal spectral resolution
          "interpl": extracts spectra from solar.kurucz.rad.mono.full_disk.bin.little_Endian and interpolates to a user specified
                     resolution


Record 3: CFLAG_FORM: Flag for output format of data

        "binary": If CFLAG='intxxxx' (xxxx='erpl','_nrl' or ''3nrl'
		     code outputs binary file for use with LBLRTM (SOLAR.RAD type file).
                  If CFLAG = 'extxxxx' outputs extracted solar data to a binary file.

         *** NOTE: Binary output files for LBLRTM consist of a single file header and multiple 
                   panels; each panel contains a panel header and data for 2400 spectral points.
                   If CFLAG ='int3nrl' each panel contains three sets of spectral points  (constant term,
                   facular brightening, sunspot darkening). 

                   Extracted binary output files consist of a single file header and multiple 
                   panels; each panel contains a panel header and data for 4000 spectral points.
                   If CFLAG ='ext3nrl' each panel contains three sets of spectral points  (constant term,
                   facular brightening, sunspot darkening). 
           
         *** VERY IMPORTANT! When running extract_solar to generate binary input for 
                             LBLRTM, it is necessary that the inputs to extract_solar and
                             LBLRTM be consistent; if they are not, LBLRTM will either 
                             generate incorrect answers or not run at all. See table below
                             for allowed combinations.

        "ascii2" outputs ascii file with one frequency and one (or three if using NRLSSI2 three 
                 component solar file) solar irradiance values per record (two or four columns)  
        "ascii1" outputs ascii file with one (or three, as above) solar irradiance values per
                 record (one or three columns)
        "asciib" outputs ascii file blocks of 80 values

         *** NOTE: All ascii output files contain a descriptive file
                   header with the following information:

	    For cases where CFLAG="extxxxx" , the header consists of

	    V1, V2, VC1, NPTS, SOL_MIN, SOL_MAX, SOL_INT

            V1 = starting wavenumber value in selected spectrum
            V2 = ending wavenumber value in selected spectrum
            VC1 = constant used to define spectral grid, 
                  where the spectral values for the NRLSSI2 data are given by
                     v_i = v1+vc1*(i-1) 
                  and for Kurucz by
                     v_i = v1*exp(vc1*(i-1)*1.e-6)
            NPTS = total number of values output
            SOL_MIN = minumum solar value output
            SOL_MAX = maximum solar value output
            SOL_INT = integrated output solar spectrum value (constant term only when file contains three terms)

            For cases where CFLAG= "intxxxx" , the header consists of

            V1, V2, DV, NPTS, SOL_MIN, SOL_MAX, SOL_INT

            V1 = starting wavenumber value in selected spectrum
            V2 = ending wavenumber value in selected spectrum
            DV = wavenumber spacing for interpolated result
            NPTS = total number of values output
            SOL_MIN = minumum solar value output
            SOL_MAX = maximum solar value output
            SOL_INT = integrated output solar spectrum value (constant term only when file contains three terms)

        The format is as follows:

        For cases where CFLAG="intxxxx" (Record 2)

	        VMIN, VMAX, DVOUT, SCALE_FAC

                VMIN: Starting wavenumber for extraction
                VMAX: Ending wavenumber for extraction

                SCALE_FAC: Scale factor applied to solar irradiance
                      function (default value is 1.0); not used
                      if binary output is requested


NOTE: All records following Record 5 are ignored. Several example cases
      are contained in the sample SOLAR_control.various file.
